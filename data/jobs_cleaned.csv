3840008580,two 12month research assistant positions on programmable data planes and mlbased network intrusion detection,università degli studi di milanobicocca,"About the job In the framework of the SHIELDED (Secure, Trustworthy, and Efficient Federated Learning for Intrusion Detection at the Edge) project two 12-month Research Assistant position are open at the University of Milano-Bicocca, Milan, Italy. The two positions are related to: Programmable Data Planes ( Position 1 ) ML-Based Network Intrusion Detection ( Position 2 ) Starting date May 1, 2024 &nbsp; Formal interview March 28, 2024 SHIELDED project description Next-generation networks include a vast amount of novel hardware, including smart Internet-of-things (IoT) devices, programmable network hardware, and computation-capable edge nodes. As the flip-side of their unprecedented capabilities, such devices – and the network they form – are vulnerable to a wide set of security attacks. To complicate matters further, attackers of all kinds are constantly hard at work to create new attacks, making the set of threats to defend from both vast and unbounded. In this context, SHIELDED aims to leverage the novel capabilities of next-generation networks – the same that are exploited by attackers – to make them able to detect and withstand the wide, open-ended set of threats they are beleaguered by. To this end, SHIELDED advances the state of the art along three main Directions: Extracting from network nodes, not only in the control plane but also in the programmable data plane, all the information necessary to gauge the state of the network, its traffic, and its end devices; Processing such information at the edge through secure and trustworthy artificial intelligence, namely, adopting the federated learning (FL) paradigm, so as to efficiently combine information coming from all peripheral parts of the network to build robust and explainable models, resistant to novel and adversarial attacks; Thanks to an orchestration layer, performing all these operations in the most efficient manner, i.e., with the smallest energy consumption and cost, selecting the most suitable hardware for each operation to perform, and configuring the network accordingly. Positions details The first position ( Position 1 ), named&nbsp;"" Definition of efficient feature extraction techniques from network packets for network intrusion detection "", is mainly related to Direction 1 introduced above. The candidate will leverage the capabilities of next-generation networks to improve the state of the art in feature extraction from packets traversing network nodes (switches) with programmable data planes using the P4 language , and optimizing the subsequent forwarding of these features to an ML model in the control plane for training and inference stages. The second position ( Position 2 ), named "" Definition of efficient federated learning techniques for network intrusion detection "", is mainly related to Direction 2 introduced above. The candidate will leverage the capabilities of next-generation networks to improve the state of the art in the elaboration of traffic features using federated learning methods . In this way, it will be possible to efficiently combine information from all peripheral zones of the infrastructure to build robust and reliable machine learning models , enabling the possibility of performing open-set classification to detect classes of unknown inputs (such as zero-day attacks). Involved research units The SHIELDED project involves the University of Milano-Bicocca (Milan, Italy), Politecnico di Milano (Milan, Italy) and National Research Council (CNR, Turin, Italy) . The candidates for both positions will work at the Department of Computer Science, Systems and Communication (DISCo) of the University of Milano-Bicocca (Milan, Italy), but will have frequent contact with other researchers working on the same project in the other research institutions of the consortium. Required skills The ideal candidate should have a Ph.D. in Information Technology or related disciplines (however, this is not a mandatory requirement, also a Master's Degree in these disciplines will be considered). The candidate for the first position ( Position 1 ) should have working/research experience on topics related to Software-Defined Networking. Any experience on Programmable Data Planes (P4 and/or eBPF) will be considered a plus. The candidate for the second position ( Position 2 ) should have working/research experience in topics related to Machine Learning applied to Networking. Any experience on Trustworthy Machine Learning will be considered a plus. Contract type and salary For both positions ( Position 1 and Position 2 ) the contract will be a 12-month, full-time, non-permanent contract. In both cases, the salary is approximately EUR 1,500 worth net per month. Working place The candidates for both positions ( Position 1 and Position 2 ) will be part of the Real-time Events and Decision Support (REDS) Lab (http://reds.disco.unimib.it/) of the DISCo Department at the University of Milano-Bicocca (Milan, Italy). The supervisor will be Dr. Marco Savi (https://www.unimib.it/marco-savi). Starting date Both positions ( Position 1 and Position 2 ) will be officially advertised in March 2024. The actual start of the contract will be on May 1, 2024. How to apply To express your interest in any of the two position, please send an e-mail complete with a brief motivation letter and CV directly to Dr. Marco Savi (marco[dot]savi[at]unimib.it). Please indicate for what position ( Position 1 or Position 2 ) you are expressing your interest .
